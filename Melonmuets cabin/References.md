I will list all the materials that I have referenced to during I was finishing my work.
These materials are for reference only. No AI has participated in this work!!!!!
# Stage 1
Slides of Week 6 & Week 7

Also, I should clarify that I borrowed the **Meng Yanxu**'s method for the tree effect demonstration, but I still wrote all the tests myself. I just borrowed the idea of showing the current tree structure through comments.
# Stage 2
I mainly refer to the classification that have been discussed in this article to realize **erase()** function.

And the insert cases classification is from WikiPedia.

**PS**:The codes are written by myself.
**PPS**: I confess that I haven't finish several cases in the **erase()** function. To be specific, if you try to erase a node who is black and his sibling and both children of its sibling are all black, my code won't work. But I assure you that in the rest cases, it should work properly. :)
