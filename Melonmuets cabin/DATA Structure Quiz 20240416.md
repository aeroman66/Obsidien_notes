1. Suppose there exist 25 elements, and we need to organize the into a Huffman Tree. The question is: how many node in total there is in this Huffman tree():
Ans: 25 - 1 + 25
Knowledge points:
- Huffman tree is a full tree
- The number of internal nodes of a full tree = leaf - 1

2. We have a sequential implementation of a General tree: **AB/D//CEG///FH//I//**. Now we try to represent it into Left child-right sibling representation. The question is which method of traversal we use to Left child-right sibling representation can give us the same enumeration as the one of sequential implementation():

Ans: Inorder
Knowledge points:
- sequential implementation
- Left child-right sibling representation.
- Traversal of a tree
